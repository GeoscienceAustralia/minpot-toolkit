Mineral Potential Toolkit
-------------------------
This repository is designed to facilitate statistical appraisal of the 
correlations between geological data / models / features, and classes of known 
mineral deposits. In the future the repository will be developed to enable the 
integration of multiple models together to generate mineral prospectivity 
assessments.
